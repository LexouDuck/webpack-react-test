# HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
---



### General Syntax

https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/html/

There are essentially two kinds of syntax for HTML tags/elements:

```html
<tag attr1="" attr2="" ... >CONTENT</tag>
```
For a container tag, eg. an HTML tag which holds content inside it (content ban be text, other HTML tags, etc)

```html
<tag attr1="" attr2="" ... />
```
For a standalone tag, such as a ReactJS component, or `<br/>`

### Basic Template

Here is a bare-bones minimal template of what a typical HTML file looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<title>My Home Page</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
		<p>Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet</p>
	</body>

</html> 
```

# List of HTML tags and attributes

This list not exhaustive nor comprehensive, just meant to be a quick recap of the important elements and attributes:

---

### _Heading tags_:

---

```html
<html lang="en-US">
	...
</html>
```
Usually encloses the entire HTML file (except for the `<!DOCTYPE html>` preceding it). Specifies language and encoding for the browser to interpret

---

```html
<head>
	...
</head>
```
Where all page metadata (HTML preprocessor info) elements are kept, this includes `<style>`, `<script>`, `<title>`, tags/keywords for bots, character encoding (`<meta charset="">`), icon (see favicon.ico), browser compatibility information (`<meta http-equiv="" content="">`).

---

```html

```
Metadata tags, generally used to make responsive web pages (pages that dynamically adapt to the size etc of the platform on which they are viewed), or just generally adapt some of the pages properties and functionalities.
```html
<meta charset="utf-8" /> <!-- defines the type of text encoding (in this example, UTF-8) -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /> <!-- special-syntax-for-what-the-client-views -->

NB: alt replaces the image with some text if necessary (used for hovertext or the hearing impaired for example).

### Usage of "class" and "id" attributes

```html
<tagname class="MyClassName">
```
Using "class" as an attribute allows you to apply anything that applies to said class everywhere it is called.

```html
<tagname id="MyElemId">
```
Using "id" as an attribute allows you to apply anything to a specific element. Technically, it is functionally equivalent to using class, but for questions of style, class will apply to a group, while id should be reserved for specific, unique elements.

---

### Character entities/ Escape sequences

In HTML one writes special sequences because of the syntactic role of some elements.
- `&lt;` for `<`
- `&gt;` for `>`
- `&nbsp;` is a non-breaking space (a space which cannot be used to jump a line)
- `&amp;` is an ampersand `&`
- `&copy;` for a copyright symbol

### HTML Layouts

https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_layout.asp
In a nutshell, the reason why Bootstrap and all these JS frameworks like Angular and React were invented. Making a layout in pure HTML is a bitch, and don't even hope to make it interactive.
